<h2>Manual Testing</h2>
    <p>Users are coming to this site with the intention of hiring or collabortating with Eoghan, it's main purpose is to showcase his abilities and passion. One arriving at the site one is met with a clear understanding of whose profile you are looking at with a Navbar that is fixed to the top of the screen throughout the site as a navigation tool. Upon scrolling you will find a biography of Eoghan accompanied with a headshot, an opportunity to build rapport with the user as we detail a brief history of his education and other information. Next we scroll up the Showreel of the site, an opportunity for us to gain some insight into what Eoghan does on set to create the outcome we can see in the corresponding video. Each video is wrapped and loaded with the YouTube controls so the user has control over the media. Information of a different kind is available in the Recent Experience section which outlines companies worked with and when. Engagement on social media is proportionate to the engagement with potential employers and so driving traffic  to Eoghan's social media is an important part of Eoghan's workflow. There is also an option to allow users to engage with Eoghan directly through the site and recieve an email reply from him.</p>
