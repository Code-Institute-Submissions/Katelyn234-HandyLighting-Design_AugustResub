</p>

<h2>UX</h2>
<h3>User Stories</h3>
<p>As a potential employer I expect to be able to access details of Eoghan's previous work and his contact information easily. </p>

<p>As a potential collaborator I expect to see samples of Eoghan's work and a sense of his work ethic.</p>

<h3>Strategy</h3>
<p>The function of this product is to inform, with that in mind the main goal of the website is to compile a portfolio of works into a comprehensive accessible design.</p>

<h3>Scope</h3>
<p>The target audience for this site's traffic was narrowed down to two profiles; 
<h4>Creative Agencies:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Production Companies</li>
        <li>Marketing Companies</li>
        <li>Executives</li>
    </ul>

<h4>Creative Individuals:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Producers</li>
        <li>Directors</li>
        <li>Other Creatives</li>
    </ul>

<p>Creative Agencies most likely require downloadable information, such a PDF resume. Whereas Creative Individuals will be looking for examples of creative expression.</p>

<h3>Structure</h3>

<p>The landing page of the website is designed to establish the who the site is about and what they do. The About page is an opportunity to express a 'sense of self' on the site while also informing about work ethics and ethos. The Portfolio follows the About to further reiterate creative style and passion. This is followed by more detailed information on previous works and a downoadable Resume, and finally links to follow Eoghan's Social Medias. </p>

<p>The Gallery page is compiled of at-work stills, behind the scenes stills etc. to futher reinforce Eoghan's brand. 

The Contact Page aims to encourage people to engage with Eoghan by pitching their project. This enables Eoghan to streamline his decision process on taking on new projects.</p>

<h3>Surface</h3>
<p>The grayscale theme was chosen for this project to illustrate the contrast between the light and dark, a most appropriate theme for a lighting designers website.</p>
